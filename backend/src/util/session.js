// Both used to live at each call site, and both were wrong in the same way —
// a value that looked right locally and silently degraded on a real install:
//
//   * the key was read as JWT_SECRET, but every installer writes
//     FORGECRM_JWT_SECRET (scripts/generate-secrets.sh, install.sh, .env.example,
//     and the header of docker-compose.images.yml all agree on that name). The
//     `||` fallback then signed real sessions with the development key printed
//     below — which is published in this repository. Meanwhile routes/mcpOAuth.js
//     verified with the *correct* name, so the two halves never agreed.
//
//   * `secure` was derived from NODE_ENV, which both compose files pin to
//     "production" even when the site is served over plain HTTP. A `Secure`
//     cookie sent to an http:// origin is discarded by the browser with no error
//     anywhere: login returns 200 and the SPA renders from the response body,
//     then the next request arrives with no cookie and gets 401. It presents as
//     "logged out on refresh", not as a cookie problem.
//
// Anything that signs, verifies or sets a session token imports from here.
