// Apply every migration this image carries, in filename order, then exit.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE scripts/migrate.sh
// -------------------------------------------
// migrate.sh shells out to `docker compose exec postgres psql` and reads the SQL
// off the host's repo. That is fine when you have the source tree — and useless
// for the image-only install, which has no repo and no psql on the host. This
// runner uses the `pg` client the backend already depends on and reads the
// migrations baked into the image at /app/migrations, so `docker compose up` on
// a machine holding nothing but a compose file brings up a correct schema.
//
// Both paths are safe to mix: they apply the same files in the same order, and
// the ledger below is advisory rather than authoritative (see IDEMPOTENCE).
//
// IDEMPOTENCE
// -----------
// Every migration in this project is required to be re-runnable (CREATE TABLE IF
// NOT EXISTS, guarded ALTERs) because re-running them is the documented upgrade
// path. So the ledger is an optimisation — it stops us replaying 88 files on
// every container start — and NOT a correctness guarantee. A file missing from
// the ledger but already applied must still succeed, which is exactly what
// idempotence buys. That is why a failure here is loud: it means a migration is
// not actually idempotent, and that is a bug in the migration.
//
// CONCURRENCY
// -----------
// Two backend containers starting at once would otherwise both run the same
// CREATE TABLE and one would lose. A session-level advisory lock serialises
// them: the second waits, then finds the ledger already populated and does
// nothing. The lock is taken on the connection and released when it closes.
